## Acheteur
An app for reserving stuff on events

### History
Acheteur was build for the different events we have with our scouting group(Scouts Zurenborg) during the year. In the beginning a system with different codeigniter installations was used. Then the codeigniter system was replaced with an laravel system. And later on this laravel system was replaced by Acheteur(which is based on laravel).

### What can it do?
Acheteur works with events, each event van have products which can be reserved for a specific shift(time slot) during the event. It is possible to add extra fields to the reserve form specific for each event.
